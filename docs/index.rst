* Easy to interface with distributed version control systems and web hooks
* Completely static output is easy to host anywhere

Features
--------

Pelican |version| currently supports:

* Articles (e.g., blog posts) and pages (e.g., "About", "Projects", "Contact")
* Comments, via an external service (Disqus). (Please note that while
  useful, Disqus is an external service, and thus the comment data will be
  somewhat outside of your control and potentially subject to data loss.)
* Theming support (themes are created using Jinja2_ templates)
* Publication of articles in multiple languages
* Atom/RSS feeds
* Code syntax highlighting
* Import from WordPress, Dotclear, or RSS feeds
* Integration with external tools: Twitter, Google Analytics, etc. (optional)

Why the name "Pelican"?
-----------------------

"Pelican" is an anagram for *calepin*, which means "notebook" in French. ;)
